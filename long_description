#VoiceLab: Fully Automated Reproducible Acoustical Analysis
VoiceLab is an automated voice analysis software. 
What this software does is allow you to measure, 
manipulate, and visualize many voices at once, without messing with 
analysis parameters. You can also save all of
your data, analysis parameters, manipulated voices, and full colour
spectrograms and power spectra, with the press of one button.


# VoiceLab
VoiceLab is written in Python and relies heavily on a package called
parselmouth-praat. parselmouth-praat is a Python package that
essentially turns Praat\'s source code written in C and C++ into a
Pythonic interface. What that means is that any praat measurement in
this software is using actual Praat source code, so you can trust the
underlying algorithms. VoiceLab also contains several features from 
Voice Sauce, another amazing acoustic analysis software.

Voice Lab figures out all of the analysis
parameters for you, but you can always use your own, and these are the
same parameters as in Praat, and they do the exact same thing because it
is Praat\'s source code powering everything. That means if you are a
beginner an expert, or anything in-between, you can use this software to
automate your acoustical analyses.

All of the code is open source and available on our GitHub repository,
so if this manual isn\'t in-depth enough, and you want to see exactly
what\'s going on, go for it. It is under the MIT license, so you are
free to do what you like with the software as long as you give us
credit.
